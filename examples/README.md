# Examples

back to [README][readme]

The library implemented in the PoC (see [**src**](src) folder) an deployed as a [NPM package](npmp) can be used in different ways.
In most of the case, the client project needs to install the package as a (dev-) dependency - depending on the intended usage of the library.

```shell
npm install --save-dev @khatastroffik/one-ts-for-all
```
Note: In a real scenario, you'd replace the name of the installed package above with the adequate name for the library of your choice.

Alternatively, the client project could download the package and manually link the library files as required.
